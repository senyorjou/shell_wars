# HISTORY

- Person talks to machine, __hello hardware give me this file please__

- 1971: Thompson Shell

- 1977: Bourne Shell
    - System V, AIX, HP-UX, SCO, Solaris

- 1978: C shell
    - BSD

- 1983: Korn Shell

- 1989: Bourne Again shell (bash)
    - POSIX
    - Linux, Mac

- 1990: Z shell

# What's that "home of a turtle"?

- Terminal, shell, tty, console --> __WTF!__

- terminal = tty: input/output environment

- console: physical terminal connected to computer

- shell: command line interpreter.

- terminal emulators or pseudo terminals
    - Things get even more complicated when you start running pseudo terminals inside pseudo terminals, à la __screen__ or __ssh__.

# Overview bash basic concepts
- Primary interface that users see when they log in, whose primary purpose is to start other programs.

- `$ man bash`

- Shell builtin few known commands: pwd, cd, echo, history, kill

- Expansion.

    - Pathname expansion

    - Tilde expansion

    - Arithmetic expansion

    - Brace expansion

    - Parameter expansion: Environment variables

    - Command Substitution

    - Quoting


# Basic concepts. Examples. 1
- Pathname expansion

        $ ls *.txt          --> anything with .txt
        $ ls plan?.txt      --> plan1.txt planZ.txt plan_.txt...
        $ ls [pf]lan*.txt   --> plan.txt, flan.txt, planazo.txt

- Tilde expansion. `~` is your home

        $ mv /tmp/*.pdf ~/pdfs/extra_material

- Arithmetic expansion

        $ echo $((8+6)) --> 14

- Brace expansion

        $ mkdir project/{public,src,dist,docs}


# Basic concepts. Examples. 2

- Parameter expansion: Environment variables

- Command Substitution

- Quoting


# Let processes talk and reproduce, and kill them

- I/O Redirection: Output, Input, pipelines.
    - example pipelines: filter and word count freq

```
grep -v hola < hello.txt > hello-filtered.txt
cat bash.txt |  tr ' ' '\n'  | grep -vi "the\|and\|a\|is\|to\|of" | grep -ve '^$' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r | head Qué
```
- Job Control
    - &, ps, kill (signalling), jobs, fg, bg

- History

```
!!
!n
!cmd
!*
{CTRL-R} / {CTRL-S}
```

- Readline Functions binding. ```bind -P```
    - Reuse arguments from previous command
    - Move efficiently through command line
    - Edit command line
        - Invoque VIM

# Configuration and other headaches

- /etc/profile
    - The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells

- /etc/bash.bashrc
    - The systemwide per-interactive-shell startup file

- /etc/bash.bash_logout
    - The systemwide login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits

- ~/.bash_profile
    - The personal initialization file, executed for login shells

- ~/.bashrc
    - The individual per-interactive-shell startup file

- ~/.bash_logout
    - The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits

- ~/.inputrc
    - Individual readline initialization file

# Bash VS Zsh. Main differences
- Software License

    - Bash: GNU, GPLv3 --> __Cannot be shipped in propietary systems__

    - Zsh: MIT-like    --> __Do whatever you want__


- Compatibility/Portability

    - Bash: POSIX.2: Shell and Utilities (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992)

    - Zsh: Enhanced features not following POSIX


# Bash VS Zsh. Most obvious improvements
- Cursor navigation on options
- Say goodbye to cd and path expansion

        ....
        /u/local/b    --> cd /usr/local/bin
        ~

- Command completion

        git ch{TAB}

- Option autocomplete

        ls -{TAB}

- Smart history

        ls {UP}



# Oh my zsh. A young shell from 1.990 with some steroids


- Programmable command-line completion that can help the user type both options and arguments for most used commands, with out-of-the-box support for several hundred commands

- Sharing of command history among all running shells

- Extended file globbing allows file specification without needing to run an external program such as find

- Improved variable/array handling

- Editing of multi-line commands in a single buffer
- Spelling correction. NO!

- Various compatibility modes, e.g. zsh can pretend to be a Bourne shell when run as /bin/sh

- Themeable prompts, including the ability to put prompt information on the right side of the screen and have it auto-hide when typing a long command

- Loadable modules, providing among other things: full TCP and Unix domain socket controls, an FTP client, and extended math functions.

- The built-in where command. Works like the which command but shows all locations of the target command in the directories specified in $PATH rather than only the one that will be used.

- Named directories. This allows the user to set up shortcuts such as ~mydir, which then behave the way ~ and ~user do.

- Themes and plugins
